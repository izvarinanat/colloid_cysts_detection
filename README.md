## Detection

For cysts detection we use [YOLOv5 Pytorch](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

### Dataset 

[Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/10p8fvmVNDhnOUbO3YDSkcO3wrtJThYAj) was collected and marked up at [N. N. Burdenko National Medical Research Center of Neurosurgery](https://www.nsi.ru/). 

Dataset includes sagittal and coronal views.
